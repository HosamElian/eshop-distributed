# 🛒 AI-Powered E-Shop with .NET Aspire & GenAI

This project demonstrates how to design and implement **cloud-native distributed architectures** using the **.NET Aspire framework**, while integrating **Generative AI (GenAI)** capabilities with **Microsoft Extensions AI** and **Semantic Kernel**.  

The system is built around an **E-Shop platform** with **Catalog** and **Basket microservices**, leveraging **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, and **RabbitMQ** for data storage, caching, and messaging. It also incorporates **secure authentication** via Keycloak and intelligent AI features such as **semantic search** and **Q&A chatbots**.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

- **Catalog Microservice**  
  - PostgreSQL for product storage  
  - Publishes integration events (e.g., `ProductPriceChanged`) via RabbitMQ  

- **Basket Microservice**  
  - Redis for fast basket storage  
  - Syncs with Catalog service  
  - Secured with Keycloak (JWT Bearer tokens)  

- **Event-Driven Messaging**  
  - RabbitMQ + MassTransit for async communication  
  - Reliable publish/subscribe patterns with error handling  

- **Blazor Client App**  
  - User-facing e-commerce front end  
  - Connects to services via .NET Aspire Service Discovery  

- **GenAI Features**  
  - AI-powered Q&A chatbot with Semantic Kernel + Ollama  
  - Semantic product search with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
